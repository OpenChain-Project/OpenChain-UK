# Sami Abatani - Test Rollout of OpenChain at ARM

So at the time I was working for ARM limited and I was given the task of trying to rationalise or standardise on the way the different business groups operate with open source use or consume open source or create open source.


And the approach that we've taken at the time is to actually try and implement the specification in only one specific group who were already aware of the licence compliance requirements.

And use that as our example to implement a robust process by which others can actually follow.

And that worked out as being very successful because that project became sort of the process that the whole group followed.

And then other groups started to be interested in it.

OK, they seemed to have an easy to follow process and know exactly what they're doing when it comes to open source licence compliance.

They almost started to advocate and sell the reasons behind why it is actually better, to try to adopt a similar approach within the other teams.

It took us about 8-9 months after that to achieve cross company licence compliance.


Thank you.
