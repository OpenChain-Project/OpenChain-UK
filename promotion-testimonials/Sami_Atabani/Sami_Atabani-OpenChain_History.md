Hello, my name is Sami Abantani and I'm an IP consultant.

Today I would like to talk to you about the history of the OpenChain project.

It started as an informal discussion between a group of experts in the technology licencing field, discussing how difficult it is to accomplish licence compliance.

These were informal discussions between people working for different companies just sharing the challenges that they face in their day-to-day job and then the idea of having a standard by which all companies can actually achieve licence compliance was shared between the
group.

And then the project was formally adopted by the Linux Foundation, with a number of companies such as ARM, Qualcomm, Siemens just as examples, to share ideas about how this could be formalised to give better licence compliance across the supply chain as the software travels across the supply chain.

And the first set of specification started by having a draft with ideas from the various members and working groups within these members just coming up with ideas what people do in their everyday job that would like to see improvement on.

Then the formal specification was launched around 2016 before an update quickly was made to capture points that perhaps were not as clear or give a little bit more detail and confidence to people who started to look at the specification and try and implement the specification.

And eventually that specification became an ISO standard well recognised across the supply chain.

Thank you.
