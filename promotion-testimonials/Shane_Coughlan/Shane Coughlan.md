# Shane Coughlan - OpenChain General Manager


Hi there, my name is Shane Coughlan and I am the general manager of the Open Chain Project.

Open chain is designed to bring people together and collaborate to make an open standard to manage the supply chain.

It is a project that has scaled globally and we have a vibrant community working on all types of supporting reference material, educational material and so on.

We work in an open source manner. Everyone can engage and contribute to our project and help make open source license compliance better.

Our goal is to create a supply chain with increased trust. We want open source compliance to be quicker, easier and more effective. Thanks to our Community, people like you, we're accomplishing that.


I hope you enjoy being part of what we do; you can get something valuable from it and I hope to welcome you as a contributor in the future.
