# Martin Yagi - First Light Fusion

At First Light we don't distribute any software either within products for sale or via a web interface....so why are we interested in OpenChain?

Well, firstly, we do utilise a lot of open source code and tools internally as key parts of our computer simulation and optimisation capability. Whilst there is no plan at present, it's very possible that in the future we will provide products or services based around this software. It will be far easier and ultimately cheaper as well to be compliant to open source licenses from the outset rather than try and fix any issues later.

Secondly, during any due diligence exercise such as major incoming investment, a merger or acquisition then questions about licenses and open source **will** be asked. It simply makes it easier and instantly credible to be able to provide suitable material and state that our policies and processes are based on OpenChain. 

In terms of the OpenChain UK workgroup, it's a fantastic opportunity to network and share best practices with like minded experts in the field and to work collaboratively on materials that help the whole ecosystem.
