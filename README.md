# OpenChain-UK
This is the repository for the OpenChain UK Work Group. The UK Workgroup provides a home for anyone in the UK interested in finding out about, implementing or being involved in the development of OpenChain, the Linux Foundation's project to provide a standard for open source supply chain management. Anything we want to make readily available to the worldwide community will be made available here.

To get involved, join the mailing list and introduce yourself!
